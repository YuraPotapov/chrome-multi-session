"""Drive the Scenario Recorder: attach, show the panel, capture, write.

The recorder is the flow engine run backwards. Instead of reading a scenario and
performing it, it watches someone perform one and writes it down - and it writes
it in the same grammar, through the same validator, into the same tree, so what
comes out is an ordinary scenario with nothing special about it.

A window launched with --recorder is a window being recorded: the panel is there
from the moment the page is attached, with no extension, no menu item and nothing
to find. That is not the same as capturing automatically - nothing becomes a step
until Capture Step is pressed - it only means the recorder does not have to be
summoned.

Polling is not a compromise here. Playwright's sync API is greenlet-based,
so a callback can only run while this thread is inside a Playwright call - an idle
recorder has to pump regardless. Given that, asking the page for its queue costs
nothing extra and survives a navigation for free: a fresh document simply answers
with an empty one.
