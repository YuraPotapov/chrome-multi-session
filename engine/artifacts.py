"""Reporting / observability: per-run report tree and configurable artifacts.

Layout:  ``reports/<timestamp>/<session>/<scenario>/`` containing the artifacts
selected for the run. By default a scenario writes ``result.json`` on success and
the full diagnostic bundle (``console.log`` / ``dom.html`` / ``result.json`` /
``screenshot.png`` / ``url.txt``) on failure - the original behaviour, left
unchanged whenever no ``--report-*`` flag is given.

The ``--report-level`` / ``--report-always`` / ``--report-screen`` flags configure
*what* artifacts are produced, *when* a report is produced, and *when* screenshots
are captured. :class:`ReportConfig` holds the parsed/validated choices and answers
"which artifacts for this outcome?"; :class:`Reporter` applies them against one
scenario's output directory. Every capture is best-effort - a diagnostics failure
must never mask the real result.
