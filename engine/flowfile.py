"""Read and write scenario files, so nothing outside the engine has to know YAML.

The GUI needs to list, edit and create scenarios, and it depends on PySide6 and
nothing else - by design, so the front-end and the launcher stay independent
environments. That makes the file format the core's business, not something the
two of them agree on: this module is the whole of it, and the launcher exposes it
over ``--flow-show`` / ``--flow-save`` (see session_launcher).

Everything written here goes back through the compiler before it reaches disk.
A file that does not compile is never written, because a scenario that cannot run
is worse than no scenario at all - it fails at the end of a launch, minutes later,
in front of whoever was watching.
