"""Load declarative flows/blocks/scenarios from the ``flows/`` tree.

Flow ids map to files by a simple convention:
  - dotted ids are paths:  ``auth.login`` -> ``flows/auth/login.yaml``
  - bare ids are scenarios: ``my_scenario`` -> ``flows/scenarios/my_scenario.yaml``
    (falling back to ``flows/my_scenario.yaml``)

There can be more than one tree. An installed build keeps its flows inside the
application bundle, where nothing can be written, so anything the user creates
lives in a tree of their own that is searched *first* - see
``runtime_paths.flows_search_path``. A scenario there shadows a bundled one with
the same id, and can still ``use:`` the blocks and named selectors the app ships.

One rule keeps that predictable: ``--flows-dir=DIR`` means exactly that directory
and nothing else. Only the default is layered. So a caller passing a directory
gets what it asked for, and a source checkout - where both trees are the same
directory - behaves as it always has.

``pyyaml`` is imported lazily so importing this module (e.g. for the domain unit
tests) does not require it.
