"""Execution overlay (HUD) - the runner's observer that drives the in-page HUD.

The runner notifies an overlay object at each execution transition (flow start,
step start/end, retry, log line, flow end). :class:`ExecutionOverlay` keeps the
live state in Python and, after every event, pushes the whole state into the
page where ``engine/hud.js`` paints it (an isolated, click-through Shadow DOM -
see that file). :class:`NullOverlay` is the no-op used when the overlay is
disabled, so the runner can call the same methods unconditionally.

Rendering happens over the existing browser adapter (``overlay_setup`` /
``overlay_render``); the overlay never touches Playwright directly, so it stays
unit-testable against a fake adapter.
