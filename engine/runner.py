    scenario being replayed against every window.
    ``overlay_components`` (from ``--execution-overlay``) enables the in-page HUD.
    ``report`` (from ``--report-*``) is a :class:`artifacts.ReportConfig`; ``None``
    means the legacy default (result.json on success, full bundle on failure).

    ``jobs`` (from ``--jobs``) is how many WINDOWS may be open at once; 1 keeps
    the original one-window-at-a-time behaviour byte for byte. Scenarios inside a
    window always run one after another - a single page cannot be driven twice -
    so this only removes the wait between windows. With more windows than jobs the
    extras queue and start as soon as a slot frees.

    ``jobs="auto"`` is the one value that lets the load governor move that number
