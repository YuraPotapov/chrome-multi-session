"""Structured event stream (JSONL) for out-of-process consumers, e.g. the GUI.

``--events=TARGET`` turns this on: ``-`` writes to **stdout**, anything else is
taken as a file path. Stdout is the natural channel because the launcher's own
logging goes to *stderr* (``logging.basicConfig``'s default) and the only prints
are the exit-immediately paths (``--help`` / ``--version`` / ``--extensions=list``),
so a consumer reads events and human log lines as two clean streams - no temp
files, no ports, no parsing of log text.

One event per line::

    {"ts": 1723545600.12, "seq": 7, "kind": "step.end", "session": "dev-agent", ...}

Two things feed it:

* :func:`emit` - called directly from the launcher and the runner for lifecycle
  events (windows launched, CDP attached, run finished).
* :class:`EventObserver` - implements the *same* observer protocol as
  :class:`engine.overlay.NullOverlay`, so the runner notifies it at every
  execution transition without knowing it exists. :class:`Tee` fans one call out
  to the in-page HUD and this observer at once.

Nothing here may raise into a run: a closed pipe (the consumer went away) or an
unserializable payload costs at most a dropped line.
