"""What the GUI says it is, and what About says about both halves.

The version is written down once, in pyproject.toml, and everything else reads
it back - the GUI included, even though it runs from its own virtualenv where
the distribution is usually not installed. A second copy in the source is the
failure this guards: it does not break anything, it just quietly reports the
wrong number forever.
