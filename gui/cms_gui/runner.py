"""Driving the launcher as a child process, and turning its output into signals.

Two channels come back and they are deliberately different things:

* **stdout** carries the ``--events=-`` JSONL stream - structured, ordered,
  machine-made. It drives the Run and Artifacts pages.
* **stderr** carries human log lines. It drives the Log page.

Everything is signal-driven on the Qt event loop; nothing here ever blocks, so a
launcher that hangs leaves the GUI perfectly responsive (and stoppable).
