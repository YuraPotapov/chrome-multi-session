"""The link to the core: where the launcher is, and what it says it can do.

The GUI never imports ``session_launcher`` - it spawns it. That keeps the two
environments independent (the GUI needs PySide6, the core needs playwright and
cryptography, and on Windows they are often not the same Python), and it means
the core stays the single source of truth: what environments, users, scenarios
and extensions exist all come from ``--describe``.

That boundary survives packaging unchanged, because an installed build ships the
core as its own executable next to the GUI's. The only thing that differs is the
shape of the command: a checkout runs ``<python> session_launcher.py ...``, an
installed build runs ``<core-exe> ...``. Both are expressed here as a script plus
an *optional* interpreter - an empty interpreter means the script runs itself.
