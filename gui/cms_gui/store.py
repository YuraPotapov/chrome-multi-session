"""Small JSON documents the GUI owns, on disk rather than in QSettings.

QSettings is the right home for a preference - a path, a flag, the last page.
It is the wrong home for a growing document: the history is hundreds of entries
deep and every write rewrites the whole blob, and an archived log is a file, not
a value. So anything that grows lives here instead, next to the logs it refers
to, in a directory the user can open and inspect.

Writes are atomic (temp file + ``os.replace``) and reads never raise: a
half-written or hand-edited file degrades to the default rather than taking a
widget down with it. That mirrors ``usersfile.save``, which is kept separate
because it also keeps a ``.bak`` and knows the shape of ``users.json``.
