"""Reading, validating and writing ``logsources.json`` - the core's own log config.

The schema is the launcher's, unchanged: an object with ``connections`` (where to
run a reader: locally or over ssh) and ``logs`` (what to read, for which
environments). The GUI is a form over that file and nothing more, so the CLI keeps
working on it untouched.

Validation deliberately mirrors ``engine.serverlog.parse_config``: the GUI must
never write a file the launcher would then refuse to read. It is *returned* rather
than raised, though, so the editor can show every problem at once and let a row sit
half-typed - which is the one place this differs from the engine's own loader.

Saving is atomic (temp file + replace) with a one-slot backup, the same as
``usersfile``: an http log's ``headers`` can carry an access token, so an
interrupted write must leave the previous file intact rather than a truncated one.
