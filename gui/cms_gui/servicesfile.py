"""Reading, validating and writing ``services.json`` - the projects and their runners.

A **project** is a name, the directory its parts live in, and the list of
services that make it up. It is the one grouping this application did not have -
environments come from ``users.json`` and describe *where a run points*, which is a
different question from *what is running on this machine*. A local Odoo, its
Postgres container and its log all belong to "Claim"; two of those three had
nowhere to say so.

The file is the GUI's own - the launcher neither reads nor needs it - but it is
kept beside ``logsources.json`` in the data root rather than in the GUI's private
directory, because it is configuration a person writes and would look for next to
the rest of theirs.

Everything about its handling is deliberately the same as
:mod:`~cms_gui.logsourcesfile`: unknown keys survive a round trip, ``validate``
*returns* its problems rather than raising so a half-typed row can sit in the
editor, and ``save`` is atomic with a one-slot ``.bak``. A settings dict belongs to
its runner type and is passed through untouched, so a type that grows a field does
not need this module to know.
