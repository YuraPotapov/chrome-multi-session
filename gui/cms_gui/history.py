"""Every run the GUI started, kept so it can be read and started again.

The launcher itself keeps no record of an invocation, and the GUI used to keep
none either: ``RunState.reset()`` and ``LogPage.clear()`` wipe the previous run
the moment a new one starts. So a run's own account of itself is assembled here
instead, from what was asked for (the configuration) and what came back (the
exit code, the pass count, the run directory, an archived copy of the log).

An entry is therefore not a log line - it is enough to reproduce the run. That
is why both halves are stored: the user-facing configuration *and* the argv it
was translated into, so a Launch Sessions entry can go back to the Launch
Sessions page and a Command entry back to the Command page, each restoring the
form the user actually filled in.
