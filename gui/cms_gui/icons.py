"""The interface's icons, painted rather than typed.

Every mark here used to be a character - a play triangle, a gear, a half-filled
square - chosen at runtime from a list of candidates by asking the body font
whether it could draw it
(see the glyph table this replaced). That works where the body font happens to
carry the symbol and fails everywhere else, and Windows is everywhere else: the
font resolved there carries almost none of them, so the whole interface fell
back to its ASCII stand-ins and the rail read "= • > +" while the toolbar
offered "% Developer mode" and "* Settings". Nothing was broken; the font simply
did not have the characters, which is not something a program can fix by
choosing a different character.

So these are drawn. Two 1px strokes on a 24-unit grid, square caps and square
joins, the same wireframe rule the stylesheet follows - and no dependency on
what is installed, which is the point. Each size is painted at its own size
rather than scaled from one bitmap, so 16px stays legible.

Colour is a parameter, not a property of the icon: the palette moves when dark
mode is set, and status marks are drawn in the colour of the status they report.
``clear_cache()`` exists for the moment the palette changes underneath.
