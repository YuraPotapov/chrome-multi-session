"""One session's backend log, in a window of its own.

The panel on the Run page keeps a folded section with the last of it, which is
right for glancing while a run goes past. Reading a log is a different activity:
it wants width for lines that are two hundred characters long, height for more
than a dozen of them at once, and somewhere to put a search that is not competing
with a step tree for the same screen. So this is the same lines, full size.

It is not modal and not a child of the panel's lifetime: several sessions can be
open side by side, which is the whole reason a per-session log is worth having
when ten windows are running as ten roles.

Live, not a snapshot - the panel pushes every refresh through :meth:`update_from`.
