"""Services & Logs: every project on this machine, what is up, and what it writes.

This page is the old Log sources page with the other half of its subject added.
That page could say which backend logs a run may stream; it could not say whether
the backend was even running, because nothing in the application had ever started
one. A local Odoo, its Postgres container and its log file are one thing to the
person using them and were three unrelated facts here.

So the page is organised by **project** rather than by kind. Each project is a
block that folds, holding two tables:

* **Services (runners)** - things this application starts and stops. Live status,
  and a console for what they print. Owned by :mod:`~cms_gui.services`.
* **Logs (observers)** - the existing ``logsources.json`` rows, unchanged in every
  respect except that a log may now name the project it belongs to. They are
  deliberately *not* tied to the runners: a log on a staging box has no runner and
  never will, and a runner's console is not a parsed log.

Two files back this, and they stay two files. ``logsources.json`` is the
launcher's and is kept exactly as valid as the CLI expects; ``services.json`` is
the GUI's own and the launcher has never heard of it. Each is loaded, fingerprinted
and saved on its own terms, so a problem in one cannot cost the other.

The projects come first and connections last. A connection serves logs across
every project, so it cannot live inside one - but it is also the part nobody
opens twice, and putting it above the subject of the page pushed the subject
down the screen.

Three things about the *view* rather than about either file:

* **What is folded stays folded.** Every section here - a project, the unassigned
  block, the connections - is remembered in QSettings and comes back the way it
  was left, whether or not anything was saved in between. It is deliberately not
  kept in the documents: folding a block is not an edit to anybody's
  configuration, so it must neither light up Save nor need one.
* **Newest first.** Blocks, services, logs and connections are shown in the order
  they were added, most recent at the top. The rows themselves carry the date
  (``added``); the lists keep the file's order, so what starts before what is
  untouched by how the page happens to sort.
* **Every table can be searched by column**, in a row of boxes under its header.
  What is matched is what the table *says*, cell by cell, so the computed columns
  - a service's status, a log's format - are searchable with no rule of their own.

And a selection means something: picking rows in a project's services narrows its
Start, Stop and Restart to those, and the buttons say so.
