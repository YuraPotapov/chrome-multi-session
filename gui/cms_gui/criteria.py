"""What a service's own log says about where it has got to.

The Services page can say whether a service's **process** is up, and that is the
weakest useful claim: a server whose port is already taken is running, and so
is one that booted cleanly. What separates them is in the log the service writes -
``started localhost:8069``, ``tests passed``, a ``CRITICAL`` line.

A **criterion** is a name somebody chose, a colour, and the logic that lights it.
It is shown beside the service and does nothing else: it never changes the status,
never gates what waits for what, never stops anything. STATUS means the process
and this means the log, and neither pretends to be the other.

**The rules are about the whole log, not about one line.** ``grep "started" &&
grep "!ERRORS"`` asks whether the log contains one thing and never contains the
other; matching both against a single line would be a different and useless
question, since no line contains ``started localhost:8069`` and the absence of
``ERRORS`` at once. So a :class:`Matcher` carries state across the run:

* a ``match`` rule is satisfied once **some** line has matched it, and stays so;
* an ``exclude`` rule is satisfied while **no** line has matched it, and is
  poisoned permanently by the first that does.

A criterion is *lit* when every match rule has been seen and no exclude rule has
been violated - which means it can go dark again. ``start`` stops being true the
moment a ``CRITICAL`` line arrives, and that is the honest reading of the notation
as well as the useful one. The state is reset when the service starts, so what is
shown always describes the current run.

Matching is case-sensitive, like grep. A regex rule can open with ``(?i)``.

Nothing here imports Qt: it is tables and matching, so it can be tested without a
widget - the same split :mod:`~cms_gui.runnertypes` makes.
