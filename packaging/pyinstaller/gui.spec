"""PyInstaller spec for the PySide6 front-end.

Produces ``chrome-multi-session-gui`` as a onedir bundle. It ships no core: the
GUI finds the core executable next to it at runtime (cms_gui.core.frozen_core),
which keeps the process boundary the front-end is built around.

Most of this file is the exclusion list. A full PySide6 install is ~650 MB
because it carries WebEngine, QML, 3D and multimedia; this GUI uses QtCore,
QtGui and QtWidgets and nothing else, so all of that is dropped.
