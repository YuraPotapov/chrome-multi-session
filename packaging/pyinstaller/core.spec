"""PyInstaller spec for the core launcher.

Produces ``chrome-multi-session-core`` as a *onedir* bundle. Onedir rather than
onefile on purpose: the GUI spawns this executable for every --describe and every
run, and a onefile build would unpack a 200 MB archive into /tmp each time.

Two things here are not automatic and are the reason this file exists at all:
the core imports almost everything lazily, so PyInstaller's analyser sees none of
it; and playwright needs its Node driver on disk in a specific place.

Built by packaging/build_deb.sh, which is also what writes build/VERSION.
