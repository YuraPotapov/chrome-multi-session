"""Flow and Step models.

A Flow is a scenario or a reusable block - the two are structurally identical,
which is what lets one block (e.g. ``auth.login``) be referenced from many
scenarios. A Step is a single normalized action or assertion. The engine's
compiler turns the declarative YAML (which supports both a verbose ``type:``
form and a shorthand single-key form) into a flat list of these Steps.
