"""Execution-plan tree model.

The compiler flattens a scenario's ``use:`` nesting into a flat list of
:class:`~domain.flow.Step` for the runner. For the execution overlay we also
want the *hierarchy* back - the scenario, each reusable block it pulls in, and
the individual actions/assertions - so the HUD can draw it as a tree.

A :class:`PlanNode` is one node of that tree. Group nodes mirror a scenario or a
``use:``-d block; leaf nodes are the individual steps. Each leaf carries
``step_index``, its position in the flat list, so the runner's ``enumerate``
index maps 1:1 onto a tree node with no bookkeeping on the runner side.
