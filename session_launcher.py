"""Open one isolated Chrome window per test user.

Each --user-data-dir is a separate Chrome profile, so every user can be logged
in at the same time. A tiny generated extension auto-fills and submits the
login form per profile, using that user's own password (once per tab, so wrong
credentials are never resubmitted in a loop).

The user list lives in a JSON config file (users.json next to this script by
default; override with --config=FILE). Each entry carries its own login, window
class and password, plus an optional env (see below). Run --init-users-json
once to scaffold a starter config (it won't overwrite an existing one). Launch a subset
with --env=NAME and/or --filter-users=login1,login2 (defaults = everything).
To launch a single user without editing the config, pass --user=LOGIN
(with --password=PASS when the config does not already know that login).

The "env" field is the environment a user belongs to - a URL or host:port, e.g.
"localhost:8069" or "https://app-dev.example.com/". --env selects one by short
name (--env=dev matches "app-dev") and supplies that environment's URL, so --url
only has to be typed to override it. Everything --env implies is a default: any
flag you pass explicitly wins over it.

Each user's profile folder is "<env>-<login>", so the env+login pair must be
unique (the same login can repeat under different envs - separate environments).
--user-session overrides the folder's prefix for the whole run.

By default the script stays in the foreground and holds a reference to every
launched window; press CTRL+C to close all of them at once. Pass --detach to
fire-and-forget instead (windows survive the script exiting, old behavior).

Profiles + generated extensions live under a sessions dir (user_sessions next to
this script by default; override with --sessions-dir=DIR).

Pass --user-session=PREFIX to override every profile folder's prefix under the
sessions dir. This keeps separate sessions from sharing logins. The per-user
login is appended automatically.

The URL can be passed as --url=URL or as a positional argument.

Each profile also gets that user's single login/password saved in Chrome's own
password manager, encrypted with this platform's Chrome key: on Linux the windows
run with --password-store=basic so cookies and saved passwords share one
deterministic key, while on macOS the key comes from the login Keychain ("Chrome
Safe Storage") - the first run there pops a Keychain prompt, choose Always Allow.

The auto-login helper is installed straight into each profile (files under
Default/Extensions plus a Preferences entry) rather than via --load-extension, which
recent Chrome (137+) blocks. By default every usable extension vendored in
extensions/ is installed the same way (a broken one is skipped with a warning, never
stopping the launch). --extensions overrides that: "none" for nothing, or a
comma-separated list of local names, Chrome Web Store names/ids, or name=id.
--extensions=list shows what is available.

Usage: python session_launcher.py [--detach] [--env=NAME] [--user-session=PREFIX]
           [--sessions-dir=DIR] [--config=FILE] [--extensions=LIST]
           [--user=LOGIN --password=PASS] (--env=NAME | --url=URL | <URL>)
   e.g. python session_launcher.py --env=dev
        python session_launcher.py --url=http://localhost:8069/web/login

Usage: %s [OPTIONS] (--env=NAME | --url=URL | <URL>)

Launch one Chrome window per configured user, each auto-logged-in via a
per-profile extension. With --run-tests it also drives flows and writes reports.

Options:
  --env=NAME                Launch one environment: matches the config's "env"
                            field by short name (--env=dev), and supplies that
                            environment's URL, so --url becomes optional.
                            Default: every environment.
  --url=URL                 Login URL (or pass it as a positional argument);
                            overrides the URL --env would supply.
  --user-session=PREFIX     Folder-name prefix for this run's profile dirs (keeps
                            separate sessions isolated); overrides the env.
  --sessions-dir=DIR        Where to store profiles + generated extensions
                            (default: user_sessions/ next to the script).
  --config=FILE             Path to the users JSON config (default: users.json).
  --init-users-json         Write a starter users.json (at --config's path) and
                            exit; never overwrites an existing file.
  --filter-users=LIST       Launch only these logins, comma-separated
                            (default: all).
  --user=LOGIN              Launch a single user instead of the config list; its
                            password comes from the config (or its environment)
                            unless --password is given.
  --password=PASS           Password to use, overriding the config's. With --user
                            it applies to that user; alone, to every selected one.
  --detach                  Fire-and-forget: leave windows running after exit.
  --extensions=LIST         Which extensions to install into every profile.
                            Default (no flag): every usable one in extensions/.
                            LIST is comma-separated names, raw 32-char store ids
                            or name=id; "none" installs nothing, "all" is the
                            default set, "list" prints what is available.
  --log-level=LEVEL         DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR (default: INFO; also via
                            the OPEN_USERS_LOG_LEVEL env var).
  --control=-               Accept JSON commands on stdin, one per line - for a
                            program driving this launcher. Currently
                            {"command":"stop-session","session":"NAME"}, which
                            stops driving that window and closes it while the
                            other windows carry on. Off by default: a reader on
                            stdin would eat a terminal user's keystrokes.
  --events=-|FILE           Emit a structured JSONL event stream for another
                            program (the GUI) to follow: windows launched, CDP
                            attached, every step, artifacts written, run summary.
                            "-" is stdout - log records go to stderr, so the two
                            never mix; anything else is a file to append to.
  --server-log=LIST         Stream the backend's own log next to the windows, each
                            session shown only the lines written after its window
                            opened. Which logs exist is described in
                            logsources.json (connections + log files); LIST is
                            comma-separated names, "all", "none", or "list" to
                            print what is configured. The bare flag - spelled
                            "default" when a value is needed - takes the logs
                            marked "default" for the environment being launched.
                            Works with or without --run-tests. Under --run-tests it
                            also writes each scenario's own slice of every streamed
                            log to reports/<run>/<session>/<scenario>/
                            server_log-NAME.log - always, pass or fail.
  --version, -V             Print the version and exit.
  --help, -h                Show this help and exit.

Editing scenarios (answer with JSON on stdout, then exit):
  --flow-show=ID            One scenario as JSON: its text, its parsed steps,
                            whether it can be edited, and anything it references
                            that does not resolve here.
  --flow-save=ID --from=F   Write a scenario from the JSON document in file F -
                            either {"yaml": "..."} or {"meta": {...},
                            "steps": [...]}. Validated by compiling it first;
                            nothing is written unless it compiles.
  --flow-delete=ID          Delete a scenario. Refuses the ones that ship with
                            the application - duplicate those instead.
  --flow-import=FILE        Copy a scenario file in, validating it first.
  --server-log-show=NAME    Read that configured log and answer JSON: its lines,
                            or the error. The last 500 by default;
                            --server-log-lines=N|all changes that. Also how you
                            find out an ssh host or a container works, before a
                            run depends on it.
  --log-sources=FILE        Where logsources.json is (default: beside the rest of
                            the config). Applies to every --server-log* flag and
                            to --describe, so the file you edit and the file a
                            run reads are the same one.
  --selectors-show          The named-target map as JSON: every name, what it
                            resolves to, and whether it is yours or the app's.
  --selectors-save --from=F Replace your selectors.yaml from the JSON document
                            in file F ({"yaml": "..."}). Names of your own
                            override the ones that ship with the application.

Recording:
  --recorder                Open ONE window with the Scenario Recorder shown in
                            it. Nothing is recorded until you ask: Capture Step
                            (or F2) picks one element and one action at a time,
                            and Finish writes the scenario.
                            --recorder=ID continues an existing scenario or names
                            a new one; the default is a timestamp.
                            Records one account at a time - you can only be
                            clicking in one window anyway - so select a single
                            user with --user=LOGIN or --filter-users=LOGIN.

Flow execution (require --run-tests):
  --run-tests=LIST          Attach over CDP, run scenarios, write reports, then
                            exit (0 = all passed). Values: all, config (each user
                            runs its own "tests" field from the config), or a
                            comma-separated list of ids / tag:NAME.
  --execution-overlay=LIST  In-page execution HUD; components tree,progress,
                            status,logs,highlight (or all). highlight flashes a
                            box on each clicked/typed/pressed element.
  --flows-dir=DIR           Where scenarios/blocks/selectors.yaml live (default:
                            flows/ next to the script). Lets the flows live in
                            their own repository. Taken literally: this becomes
                            the ONLY tree, so the blocks and selectors.yaml your
                            scenarios reference have to be in it too - nothing
                            that ships with the application is searched behind
                            it. Needs no --run-tests: it applies to --describe
                            and the --flow-* commands as well, which is how the
                            GUI edits a tree of your own.
  --reports-dir=DIR         Where run artifacts are written (default: reports/).
  --jobs=N|all|auto         Drive N windows at once (default 1 = one after
                            another); extras queue for a free slot. Scenarios
                            within a window always run in order. A number is
                            kept: nothing raises or lowers it. "auto" starts at
                            one window per core and lets the machine decide -
                            fewer while memory is under real pressure, back up
                            again once it is not. With --close-after this also
                            caps how many windows are OPEN at once, launched a
                            slot at a time and closed as they finish; "auto"
                            needs --close-after to have anything to give back.
  --close-after             Close the browser windows once the run finishes;
                            without it they stay open for inspection - which
                            also means every window is launched up front.

Reports (require --run-tests):
  --report-level=LIST       What artifacts to generate from the browser:
                            console,dom,result,screen,url (default: result on
                            success, the full bundle on failure). Backend logs are
                            not in here - --server-log decides those.
  --report-always           Produce a full report on success too, not only
                            on failure.
  --report-screen=LIST      When to capture screenshots: start,each,finish
                            (only when 'screen' is in --report-level).

Example:
  %s --user=admin --password=admin --url=http://localhost:8069 \\
    --run-tests=my_scenario --report-level=result,screen --report-screen=start,finish\
